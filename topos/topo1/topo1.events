# This file contains a list of link change events to execute in the simulated
# network. Columns are as follows:
#
# <time> <link> <bandwidth> <latency>
#
# time: time (in seconds) after the previous event that this event should run
# 		Floats are ok. The character '*' indicates the event should wait to
#		run until the user presses enter.
#
# link: The link to modify. This must be one of the bottleneck links specified
#       in your .bottlenecks file. It must be a string of the format
#       "link<num>" where <num> is an integer between 1-9999 (inclusive).
#
# bandwidth: The BW to set. Should include unit (e.g., 1mbit or 500kbit)
#
# latency: The artificial latency to impose on the link. Should include unit
#		   (e.g., 200ms or 1s)
#

# Use this event list for generating the plots for your writeup. If you want
# to make other event scripts for testing purposes, make them in separate files
# and use the -e flag on netsim.py (run netsim.py -h for more info).

0 link1 1mbit 0ms  # start link BW at 1 mbps
30 link1 500kbit 0ms  # after 30 seconds, decrease to 500 kbps

# continue with your own test scenarios...
